\begin{titlepage}
    % First we create an empty page
    \clearpage\thispagestyle{empty}
    \setstretch{1}

    % So here we are creating a kind of a header section (align to the top of the page ) which consists of two another sections which both take 50% (0,5) of the mother section: 

    % Now we make some vertical space
    \vspace{4cm}


    % We separate the next part of the code so that the title formatting applies only to the selected section
    {
        % Center our title in the middle
        \centering

        % Add title (huge size, bold) and \par is just to start new paragraph
        \Huge\bfseries Test\par


    }


\end{titlepage}
